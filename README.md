## Hi, I am Jari Ahonen 🎚

* 🔭 I am a teacher of math, chemistry, physics and CS in a vocational school.
* 🌱 I have been learning programming as a hobby since autumn 2024.
* 👨‍🎓 [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/u/jarimus) has been the best site for my journey.
* 😁 I am especially interested in Python (data analysis) and Go (back-end and CLI).
* 💪 One day I will delve more into front-end development. (React? Svelte? Something else?)
